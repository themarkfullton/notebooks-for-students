# Notebooks for Students

Basically just a place where I add Colab Notebooks I've written up for students to ensure they'll have access to them (since I have a propensity towards deleting everything in my google drive).

## Naming Scheme

In case you're a student sent here that wants to look at other notebooks:

 [ _technology/package/language_ ]_[ _task_ ].ipynb

## Data

I haven't uploaded the data sources here since I'll occasionally throw together examples whose sources are (1) supposed to be confidential or (2) massive. Hence, you might not be able to run the example even if you clone the repo. The main purpose here is sharing the logic of the task at hand.
